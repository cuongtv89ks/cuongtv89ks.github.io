When my friend called to me and asked me to help him to play guitar for his song, I said I can not help him because I am not good enough to perform in front of crowed people. Before that I have some bad experiences that I performed in International Students Festival at Chungnam University. Then he gave to me 2 options that were ["Nồng Nàn Hà Nội"]() and ["Quê nhà"]() (performed by Tung Duong). Then I said "OK, let do it" because I love this song when I were in high school, and wished I could perform this song. That's the reason I did not hesitate to join immediately.

However, we do not have enough time to practice (practice with the girls that sing in part only 3 - 4 times). Then when We performed, we did not check the micros of guitar, the main singer and singers in parts. Therefore, as you can listen, it is not good. But I was very happy because I overcome my fear (standing in front of crowed people). And when you listen separately, the sound of guitar and the voice of main singer are not bad :D, right? ^^!
